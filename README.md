# Price_Tracking_hackathonProject
Hey, in this video we are going to use Puppeteer to build an project that is able to scrape dynamic websites, like Amazon. The idea is simple: project will run in the background, and use web scraping to check the price of selected product on Amazon. Every single hour app will check if the price has dropped below some value, if so, the app will send us an email with notification.
